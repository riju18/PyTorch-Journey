# Learning & experimental Project :
## Comparison with Tensorflow :
+ ANN :
  + Speed :
    + Slower than TensorFlow in both CPU and GPU
  + Evaluation :
    + PyTorch reduced more FN than Tensorflow
    + Accuracy is 2-3% better than Tensorflow
  + Summary :
    + Need more experiments to evaluate which one is better in particular dataset
